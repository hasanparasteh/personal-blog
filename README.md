## How to Start

First of all, you need `Python3` and `Node.js` installed on your system...

#### Linux

pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Windows

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Contributions

I am now growing my application to be completed and I need your contributions to exist in this area. So if you have any idea to improve code quality I'm so happy to hear from you at [hasanparasteh@gmail.com](mailto:hasanparasteh@gmail.com).

**Before writing any code please be aware of `pre-commit` configs. It checks your code and format it with `black` before each commit! to configure it for your device just run `pre-commit install` on your terminal.**

### Todo
